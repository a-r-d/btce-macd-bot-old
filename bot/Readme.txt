I am getting a lot of positive backtests happening. I would like to create a spreadsheet or something so we can organize the data and compare what algorithms are the best. This will take some time I think. I also need to start figuring out how I will write the bot in a way that we can re-use the most code and plug in parameters easily. Idk, lots to think about. Trying to keep it simple for now. In practice we will find lots of things to tweak I think. 

Another concern of mine thinking about the code is that BTC-e also does not have a "market price" trade order type. Every order at BTC-e is a LIMIT order where the order fills at the exact price you enter. I think if you have traded much on NYSE or NASDAQ you find this weird as most brokers if you BUY will default to a market order which will fill at whatever price the lowest ask is. 

What this means is that we may have situations where trades will hang out at a high or low price for a long time while the market swings another direction because the order didn't fill entirely.... This will tie up funds. Not sure how to deal with this yet... It did not matter for the last bot I made because it was essentially a different type that depended on LIMIT orders to work.
