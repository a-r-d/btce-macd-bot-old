# Btce moving averag bot (MACD strategy)

Some old hacky code I wrote in python, when I still did that, to try to do a MACD strategy agains the btc-e.com exchange.

I got some positive backtests but I never felt like the margin of error was high enough to do this profitably.

This code is old and fairly embarrassing, but I was not trying to practice good engineering principals. I was trying to a proof of concept and test if something worked.
